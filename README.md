:leaves: TREES leaf development submodel :leaves:
-------------
This repository contains files associated with our paper on genotype-informed process model parameters of leaf development in *Brassica rapa* using the biophysical model, **Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES)**. The manuscript is currently in preparation and we will update the citation accordingly:

Diane R. Wang, Carmela R. Guadagno, Xiaowei Mao, D. Scott Mackay, Jonathan R. Pleban, Robert L. Baker, Cynthia Weinig, Jean-Luc Jannink, Brent E. Ewers. Can genomics inform physiological complexity in plant process models? (*in prep.*)


Two folders are found in this repository:

*   **get_leaf_parameters** contains scripts and a leaf area dataset to derive genotype-specific leaf growth parameters. A phenotyping pipeline may be found in Supplementary Figure 10 of the paper. 

*   **TREES** contains input files along with the updated TREES model used in our study.

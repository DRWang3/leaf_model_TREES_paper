This repository contains files associated with our study on genotype-informed process model parameters of leaf development in *Brassica rapa* using the biophysical process-based model, **Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES)**. The manuscript is currently in preparation and we will update the citation accordingly:

Diane R. Wang, Carmela R. Guadagno, Xiaowei Mao, D. Scott Mackay, Jonathan R. Pleban, Robert L. Baker, Cynthia Weinig, Jean-Luc Jannink, Brent E. Ewers. A framework for genomics-informed ecophysiological modeling in plants. *Journal of Experimental Botany,* in press


Two folders are found in this repository:

*   **get_leaf_parameters** contains scripts and a leaf area dataset to derive genotype-specific leaf growth parameters. A phenotyping pipeline may be found in Figure S1 of the paper. 

*   **TREES** contains the updated model along with input files for the drought validation modeling and *in silico* population simulations done in our study.
